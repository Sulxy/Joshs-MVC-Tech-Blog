## Installation
If you wanted to customize it yourself, you would need to clone the repository, install the npm dependencies, and create a ".env" file with your mysql login credentials in the root directory. 

## Usage
You need to first create a login by signing up. Once that is done, you should have full access to post your own topics, and comment on other already existing topics!

## Tests
Clone the repo, install npm dependencies, create ".env" file w/ your mysql credentials. Navigate to the \db file, and spin up your local mysql sever in one terminal, and then "source schema.sql". In a seperate terminal, navigate to the root directory, and "npm run seeds", and then "npm start". This will allow you to use your browser at "localhost:3001" to navigate a non-deployed version of the website.

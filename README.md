## Installation
If you wanted to customize it yourself, you would need to clone the repository, install the npm dependencies, and create a ".env" file with your mysql login credentials in the root directory. 

## Usage
You need to first create a login by signing up. Once that is done, you should have full access to post your own topics, and comment on other already existing topics!

Clone the repo, install npm dependencies, create ".env" file w/ your mysql credentials. Navigate to the \db file, and spin up your local mysql sever in one terminal, and then "source schema.sql". In a seperate terminal, navigate to the root directory, and "npm run seeds", and then "npm start".
